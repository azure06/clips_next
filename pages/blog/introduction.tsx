            When using our devices, we all have to copy some text, pictures, or
            files now and then. However, our operating systems do not have a
            clipboard with storage. That means, once we copy another thing, the
            previous copy is gone forever, and it could be a problem if we
            cannot find it again. Clips will help you out in this type of
            situation.

              Let&apos;s say you have to complete an essay given to you as an
              assignment. To complete that essay, you have 100s of tabs open,
              and you are copy-pasting stuff to add to your assignment. You
              copied a text to add, but forgot to paste it, and copied something
              again. Now, you&apos;ve lost your previous copy, and you cannot
              find it from the 100s of tabs you have opened. In such a scenario,
              if you have clips, you can go to the application and see your
              previous copies, and get it directly from there. It saved you the
              effort and hours that would have been wasted otherwise.
