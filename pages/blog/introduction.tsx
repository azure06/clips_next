            When using our devices, we all have to copy some text, pictures, or
            files now and then. However, our operating systems do not have a
            clipboard with storage. That means, once we copy another thing, the
            previous copy is gone forever, and it can be a problem if we cannot
            find it again. The clipboard Manager application &quot;CLIPS&quot;
            is here to help you out in this type of situation.

              much time passes, you can always open the Clips software to
              retrieve it again. You can also have your favorite copies starred

              Let&apos;s say you have to complete an essay given to you as an
              assignment. To complete that essay, you have 100s of tabs open,
              and you are copy-pasting stuff to add to your assignment. You
              copied a text to add, but forgot to paste it, and copied something
              again. Now, you&apos;ve lost your previous copy, and you cannot
              find it from the 100s of tabs you have opened. In such a scenario,
              if you have clips, you can go to the application and see your
              previous copies, and get it directly from there. It saved you the
              effort and hours that would have been wasted otherwise.
